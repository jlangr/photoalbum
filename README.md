# Development notes

- delivering to one person, Emma Langston
- assuming simple requirements unless otherwise specified
- no need for internationalization. However: it's a pain to retro-introduce variables(?) for embedded text, particularly in HTML, so that is introduced here

## Goals of solution

- Minimize over-engineering
- Minimize effort spent, particularly in lieu of (a) getting MVP to customer to await further instruction
