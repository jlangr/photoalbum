# Development notes

- delivering to one person, Emma Langston
- building to requirements as stated unless otherwise specified
- no need for internationalization. However: it's a pain to retro-introduce variables(?) for embedded text, particularly in HTML, so that is introduced here

## Goals of solution

- Minimize over-engineering
- Minimize effort spent, so as to deliver MVP to customer sooner
- Ensure high confidence that application works as expected, primarily through unit tests
- Ensure high quality design to reduce cost of future change
